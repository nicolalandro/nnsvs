## History

This is my hobby project. I have an prototype of singing voice synthesis system locally, and plan to make it open source and continue to improve it. At the moment I was writing this, the project is still quite far from my goal. Software design is not fixed yet, and lots of fundamental problems are remained unsolved (e.g., accurate F0 prediction including vibrato parameter estimation). Please understand that this is my personal project and I may be slow to make progress. That said, I am excited to learn singing voice synthesis technology and make an useful open-source tool for it. If you have any requests or comments, please let me know and I would appreciate your contribution. https://github.com/r9y9/nnsvs/issues/1
